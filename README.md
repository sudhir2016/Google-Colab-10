VGG16 based mask detector. 
The steps are as follows.

- Load TensorFlow, Keras and Python libraries.
- Load the with_mask and without_mask images.
- Preprocess the data.
- Load the VGG16 network.
- Add a head layer to the model to train on mask detection.
- Train the model on training data.
- Evaluate the model on test data.
- Use the model for predictions.
- Verify predictions.
